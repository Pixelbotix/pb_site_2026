            <p>
              PixelBotix ships products through reputed courier and logistics partners.
              EMS Speed Post may be used on special request for remote or non-serviceable
              locations. While we aim to ship all items in a single consignment,
              certain products may be shipped separately due to size, availability,
              or handling requirements.
            </p>

              2. Shipping Time & Delivery Timeline
            </h2>
            <p>
              Orders are typically shipped on the same business day. Approximately
              99% of orders are dispatched within 24 hours on working days
              (Monday to Saturday, excluding public holidays).
            </p>
            <p>
              Orders placed on Sundays or public holidays will be processed on the
              next working day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Same-day delivery may be available for select locations for orders placed
              before 1:30 PM. Expected delivery window is between 3:00 PM and 10:00 PM.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we target delivery within 2-5 business days across India, actual
              delivery timelines depend on courier service providers and regional
              logistics constraints.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Once an order is dispatched, customers will receive shipment details
              via email and SMS, including the courier name and tracking (AWB) number.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers can track shipments using the provided tracking details.
              For out-of-stock items, a “Notify Me” option may be available on the
              product page.
            </p>
            <p>
              In rare cases where courier service is unavailable in a specific area,
              PixelBotix may attempt alternate arrangements or may decline the order.
